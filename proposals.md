### Can we default to CSS for animations now?
Proposed to: CSS Conf BP

Before HTML5 came along, we never really thought about using CSS for animating elements on the screen. With CSS3 we finally got different properties to animate. But it seems developers are still shying away from using CSS when it comes to animations. With vendor prefixes beginning to disappear more and more, let's take a look at some cases where we used to use JavaScript for animations, but may be better suited for CSS animations and transitions.

This talk will be part history lesson, part showcase, part live coding. I will go into detail on how the pros and cons of CSS transitions and animations in terms of performance and maintenance. I will present a few use cases on animations in web sites and web apps from dropdowns, tooltips and character animations (where we used to use GIFs or videos). We will take a look at how this example would look like in JavaScript and how we can simplify them with CSS.

### React for Game Development
Proposed to: React Conf 2015, React Amsterdam, React Europe

Using React for game development may not seem like an obvious choice at first. With React itself being compared to the Doom 3 game engine at F8 2014, we may not be in such a bad spot. At first, we will take a look at how games are usually structured. Then we will examine different concepts in game development such as the entity-component pattern and how we can . At the end, we'll take a look at all  put it all together into a React-powered game.
