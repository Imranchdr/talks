          <Slide notes="When choosing a traditional UI framework like Bootstrap or Foundation, I was longing for more. Since I really liked the way I was defining my routes in JSX with React Router, I wanted something similar for theming. Instead of being able to author my theme-related logic in JSX, CSS or preprocessors are the way to go. The components structure that we have in the app does not really apply to CSS and we always have context switches between styling our component and modifying our component.">

So I think we are onto something here.">

But it feels too much of being a quick and dirty solution, since it does not provide any constraints. Usually, we would just some style changes applied through themes instead of allowing everything to be potentially changed.">

Let's imagine a withStyle HoC that takes in a component and the colors. Those are being passed into our component as props. Going a step further, we could centralize these styles. And even a step further, we could then define our theme switching logic in JSX.">
